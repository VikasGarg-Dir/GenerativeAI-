# 🧠 Generative AI

Welcome to the **Generative AI** repository — a collection of projects, experiments, and code samples focused on building intelligent applications using state-of-the-art Generative AI techniques.

## 🚀 About

This repository showcases a range of Generative AI implementations with a focus on:

- Intelligent **chatbot applications**
- Integration with **Langchain** and **LLM frameworks**
- Use of **OpenAI GPT models** and other language models
- Building tools and features around **prompt engineering**, **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, and **agent-based systems**

Whether you're experimenting with LLMs or building full-stack AI-powered apps, this repo provides practical examples to get started and scale.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Langchain**
- **OpenAI / GPT-3.5 / GPT-4**
- **Streamlit / Gradio (for UI)**
- **Vector Stores (e.g., FAISS, Chroma)**
- **Other LLM frameworks and APIs**
